# Location based weather app

## How does the app work? 

-- simply open the index.html file and you will be prompted to confirm that you want your browser to know your location
-- after your consent, your location's longitude and latitude will be used to initiate an API call to the __"Open Weather Map"__ service
--you need to have a local server set up or else the information from the API will not be delivered

### Setting up a local web server (localhost) 
-- this can be very easily done with the __Brackets__ code editor
-- you can find this code editor at: Brackets.io
