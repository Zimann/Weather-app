# Location based weather app

## How does the app work? 

- simply open the index.html file and you will be prompted to confirm that you want your browser to know your location
- the page can also be accessed directly at : https://zimann.github.io/weather-app/
- after your consent, your location's longitude and latitude will be used to initiate an API call to the __"Open Weather Map"__ service
- a small shield will appear on the right side of the url bar stating "This page is trying to load scripts from unauthenticated resources"
- click on the shield and choose to load the scripts for the temperature to be displayed
